## EcoSearch

This is the frontend project I did to learn more about TailwindCSS + NextJS. A pretend search engine (usings Google API for backend) which is environmentally oriented.

### How you may ask?

Well! We have a feature called EcoCheck which uses an API to find out a website's carbon emission and other eco-friendly options! This way you know if a website is eco-friendly or not. By utilzing this idea, I show my business-minded apporach as I was able to create a product based on a business-need of an "eco" related theme!

### Can I contribute?

Of course! Just create a PR (DON'T COMMIT ON MAIN) and I will look it over whenever I get the chance! Please bear in mind that I am a student so reviewing might take a while because of other more important duties I adhere too!
